When I search for a city in the weather dashboard the current and future conditions for that city is displayed and that city is listed in the search history.
I can see the current condition for that city, the city name, the date, a weather condition icon, temperature, humidity and wind speed are displayed.
In the next section, a 5 day forecast is displayed that shows the date, a weather condition icon, temperature, humidity and wind speed.
